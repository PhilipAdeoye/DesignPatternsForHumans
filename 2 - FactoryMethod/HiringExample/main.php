/*
 * Factory Method
 * 
 * It provides a way to delegate the instantiation logic to child classes
 * 
 * In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational 
 * pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating 
 * objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will
 *  be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method
 * â€” either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or 
 * implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classesâ€”
 * rather than by calling a constructor.
